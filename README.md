ðŸš€ **My Experience with Docker and Kubernetes**

Guestbook Project - A simple web application using Docker and Kubernetes as part of the IBM Skills Developer platform. This hands-on project helped me understand containerization and orchestration concepts.

:star: **Key Accomplishments**

â€¢	Created **Docker images** for the application to package it into containers.

â€¢	Using Kubernetes, deployed and managed these containers with **_kubectl_** commands.

â€¢	Implemented Single web page where users can input text and submit it. 

â€¢	Set up Kubernetes **Deployments** and Pods to run the application effectively.


:chart_with_upwards_trend: **Advanced Features**

â€¢	Applied dynamic **Horizontal Pod Scaling** to ensure the application could handle varying workloads efficiently.

â€¢	Practiced updating the application seamlessly and reverting changes when necessary, using **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**.

1. Created a Docker image for a Guestbook application written in Go. It employs a multi-stage build process to optimize the final image size and improve security. Docker build command:  _- docker build . -t       us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1_.

2. Pushed the Docker image into the IBM cloud container registry using _docker push us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1_ and verified.

4. Implemented Horizontal Pod Autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of application instances based on demand.

5. Observed the increase in the number of replicas which shows that the application has been autoscaled.

6. Prepared a second revision of the application by updating the Dockerfile and initiated a rollout to deploy the changes.
